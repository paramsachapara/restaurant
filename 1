Yes, we will need a backend and a database ‚Äî but only for specific purposes. Here‚Äôs what we envision:

‚úÖ What should be stored:

‚Ä¢ Driver progress data
(e.g. completed quizzes, scores, improvement over time)
‚Ä¢ Quiz history per driver
(e.g. which questions were answered, correct/incorrect responses)
‚Ä¢ Error archive
(centralized pool of delivery mistakes linked to quiz questions)
‚Ä¢ Language preferences
(so the app remembers the selected language per user)


‚ùå What should not be stored:

‚Ä¢ No personal data like name, address, phone number
‚Ä¢ No GPS or location tracking
‚Ä¢ No Amazon account details


All data storage must be GDPR-compliant, and ideally anonymized unless the user explicitly consents.

üîß Tech suggestion:

‚Ä¢ Lightweight backend (e.g. Firebase, Supabase, or Node.js with PostgreSQL)
‚Ä¢ Local caching for offline use
‚Ä¢ Option to expand to cloud-based analytics later


Let me know if you need a full backend architecture sketch ‚Äî I can help with that too!
